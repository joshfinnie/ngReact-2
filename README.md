# ngReact-2

This is a look at how to "Sneak React into Angular". This is based off of a previous talk I did [here](http://slides.com/joshfinnie/sneaking-react-into-angular/#/), but this time we are not using the [ngReact](https://github.com/ngReact/ngReact) library.

## Setup

Run `npm install`, then `npm start`. This should start a webservice and the site can be viewed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost.8080).

## The Goal

The goal was to see if it was possible to add React Components into an Angular application. I also wanted to see if rendering a React Component over a lot of data would be quicker than using an `ng-repeat` directive. Unfortunately, I cannot say one way or the other.
